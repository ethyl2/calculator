# Calculator Code Challenge

Challenge is found here: https://scotch.io/bar-talk/code-challenge-2-build-a-calculator-with-css-grid

The original challenge is to use CSS grid to create the layout of a calculator.

Once I accomplished that, I added functionality to my calculator.

## Additional Features

- Besides basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, my calculator also handles decimal points and toggling the postive/negative sign.

- I added a dark mode option for the display, and the default display should correspond to a user's display preferences.

- This app also displays quotes about mathematics. A random one is picked each time the app loads.

- I improved the UX of the buttons: The buttons in the calculator are disabled when they should not be used and are displayed differently when that is the case. Also, their colors change when hovered over, and appear to move slightly when pressed.

## Other Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
